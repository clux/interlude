# Interlude API
For document brevity, $ is assumed to be the require placement of
interlude, fn/f/g/h are assumed to be function names, anything ending in s
is an array, and when applicable, x is related to xs by being an element of.


## Functional Extras
To come. Needs some more thought.

## TODO:
how to split everything:

- operators: associatives/non-associatives + manually lifted versions
- subset: comparison/equality + everything using them (set ops/max)
- common + math + accessors(incl. first/last) + looping(zip/range/iterate/map/invoke..) + seq
- function wrappers
