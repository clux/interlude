0.3.0 / TODO
==================
  * DOCS
  * tests for wrappers
  * move operators to `operators`
  DONE:
  * more operators
  * $.equality2 and $.comparing2 properly added with curried counterparts
  * removed way too specific setters
  * renamed `collect` to `pluck` to conserve conventions
  * delete/insert/deleteBy/insertBy now all modify input (insertBy didn't)
  * delete/deleteBy now only deletes first occurrence
  * difference/differenceBy introduced
  * remaining listify stuff now dependency free apart from $.eq2,$.subtract2
  * general compose performance bad, so made faster specific sequencers
