# Functional JavaScript Programming
The aim of this module (unlike many similar helper libraries) is not to replace/alias ES5 methods,
nor is it to simply stuff a bunch of helpers on Array.prototype. Instead, it exports what has been shown by
experience to be great additions to the ES5 reportoire as curried functions.

Currently, only a preview version is available on npm, but docs, tests, and additions are coming.
